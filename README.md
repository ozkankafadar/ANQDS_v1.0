# ANQDS_v1.0
Artificial and Natural Quake Discrimination Software

ANQDS is an open-source and MATLAB-based graphical user interface developed to discriminate the natural and artificial seismic events. The program uses a semi-automatic algorithm based on four different methods to analyze the seismic data; a) amplitude ratio, b) complexity, c) short-time Fourier transform and d) power spectrum density. It uses two different statistical methods to classify the data; a) linear discrimination function and  b) quadratic discrimination function. ANQDS has the ability to automatically analyze a selected seismic event using the amplitude ratio and complexity methods. The program needs user interpretation for analyzes based on the short-time Fourier transform and power spectrum density methods.

This software was developed within the scope of AFAD National Earthquake Research Program (UDAP-Ã‡-19-13).
