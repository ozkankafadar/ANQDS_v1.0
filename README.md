# ANQDS_v1.0
Artificial and Natural Quake Discrimination Software

ANQDS is an open-source and MATLAB-based graphical user interface developed to distinguish natural and artificial seismic events using the seismograms recorded by AFAD weak ground motion stations. The program uses a semi-automatic algorithm based on four different methods to analyze the seismic data; a) Amplitude peak ratio, b) Complexity, c) Short-time Fourier transform and d) Power spectrum density. It uses two different statistical methods to classify the amplitude peak ratio and complexity data; a) Linear discrimination function and  b) Quadratic discrimination function. ANQDS has the ability to automatically analyze a selected seismic event using the Amplitude peak ratio and Complexity methods. The program needs user interpretation for analyzes based on Short-time Fourier transform and Power spectrum density methods.
This software was developed within the scope of AFAD National Earthquake Research Program (UDAP-Ç-19-13).
